# Restart — Team Structure & Governance Alignment (Locked)
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-02 (CST)  
**Artifact Type:** Restart  
**Restart Class:** Strategic / Governance  
**Status:** Locked  

---

## 1. Team Structure (Updated)

**Team Name:** Team Qwrk

Team Qwrk is the formal collaborative build and strategy unit responsible for designing, governing, and implementing Qwrk.

### Team Members & Roles

#### 1. Master Joel (Human Architect)
- Vision holder and final authority  
- Governing judgment and tradeoff resolution  
- Decides truth, pacing, and direction  
- Guards against system drift and parallel-reality builds  

#### 2. ChatGPT Project — QP1 (Joel’s Journal)
- Strategic thinking, reflection, synthesis  
- Governance interpretation and alignment  
- Snapshot creation, seed / sapling / tree framing  
- Adaptive framing and meaning-layer exploration  

#### 3. Claude Code
- Implementation specialist  
- Executes only on explicit prompts  
- Never overwrites artifacts without instruction  
- Optimized for careful, stepwise construction

## 2. Build Project Clarification

### ANQ — AAA_New_Qwrk

**ANQ (AAA_New_Qwrk)** is a dedicated build-assist project operating within Team Qwrk.

**Purpose:**
- Acts as the *primary construction interface* for New Qwrk  
- Receives prompts, schemas, and instructions from Team Qwrk  
- Does **not** decide architecture, truth, or governance  
- Implements only what has been framed, approved, and restart-locked  

ANQ is explicitly **subordinate to governance documents** and the **AUTHORITATIVE INDEX**.

---

## 3. Governance Reinforcement

- The **AUTHORITATIVE INDEX** is the single interpretation authority  
- **ACTIVE** documents are binding  
- **SUPERSEDED** documents are historical only  
- **CONTEXTUAL** documents inform but do not govern  

No build activity proceeds without:
- Clear forest identification  
- Snapshot or governing reference  
- Explicit execution prompt  

---

## 4. Operating Principle (Reaffirmed)

> Two streams are allowed.  
> Two truths are not.

Team Qwrk will never operate two build streams within the same Forest simultaneously.

---

## 5. Restart Intent

This restart exists to:
- Prevent role confusion  
- Prevent overwrite risk  
- Preserve cognitive clarity  
- Lock in the Team Qwrk operating model  

**Status:** Authoritative until superseded by a future restart.
