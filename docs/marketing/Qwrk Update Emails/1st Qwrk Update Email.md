Welcome to the first official Qwrk Update email.  I've BCC'd everyone to hide identities.  If you do not want to receive this email in the future you are welcome to just let me know.  A few of you are not familiar with my project: Qwrk, but most of you are.  To put it simply, Qwrk is my personal AI assistant that I have envisioned since ChatGPT came out.  Read on to learn more.  

I've been working on the current iteration of Qwrk for about 2 months now and as of earlier this week, I took everything I've learned and tried and restarted Qwrk from scratch and I'm very glad I did.  Soon I will send out an email to anyone who wishes to get these updates asking you to please sign an NDA - I'll make it as painless as possible and I appreciate it.

Along with the full restart, this week saw the addition of Claude Code to the toolbox and my "build team": Team Qwrk.  Which now consists of: 

1. Me
2. A ChatGPT Project called: QP1 (with documentation files attached).
3. A ChatGPT Project called: AAA_New_Qwrk (with documentation files attached).
4. A Supabase database acting as "Qwrk's Brain" (no actual Qwrk front end interface yet, but it will be up soon as a CustomGPT) storing artifacts as "permanent memory" for Qwrk.
5. An instance of Claude Code called: "CC" (it actually writes my workflow files for me now.  Greatly ramping up my productivity).

Why Good Ideas Keep DisappearingIf you work with ideas — especially with AI — this probably sounds familiar.You have a great conversation with ChatGPT or another tool.
You clarify something important.
You generate real, usable insight.Then you start a new chat.And most of it is gone.Sure, there are “projects.”
Sure, there’s “memory.”But in practice, each conversation still feels and mostly functions, like a reset.
Your past thinking doesn’t really accumulate. It just… fades.

Or, if you don't work with AI at all, this paradigm still applies.  I'm sure the number of "great" ideas I've forgotten over my life would astound me.  Well, no longer.The Real FrustrationIdeas don’t usually fail because they’re bad.
They fail because they lose continuity.They get scattered across:Chat threadsNotesHalf-finished docs“I’ll come back to this later”Even when the work was good — even when AI helped — there’s no trusted place where it all stays together and keeps growing.So every time you come back, you end up re-explaining yourself… or starting over.Why I'm Building QwrkQwrk exists because this shouldn’t be normal.Qwrk is designed to work the way you wish ChatGPT projects or custom GPTs, or other AI tool's similar features, worked; as a long-running thinking partner, not a collection of disposable conversations.With Qwrk:Ideas don’t disappear when a chat endsGood work doesn’t get overwritten or lostYou can pause and resume without rebuilding contextYour history stays intact — decisions, reflections, and progress includedYou still do the thinking.
Qwrk makes sure it doesn’t evaporate.What Changes in PracticeInstead of restarting:Ideas can start small and grow naturallyJournaling stays honest — nothing quietly rewrittenProjects evolve over time instead of resettingAI becomes a partner across sessions, not just within oneThe goal isn’t more productivity theater.
It’s continuity.The Bottom LineQwrk helps you move forward without losing your past.Your ideas, decisions, and momentum stay connected — the way real thinking actually works.More soon, if you want.
