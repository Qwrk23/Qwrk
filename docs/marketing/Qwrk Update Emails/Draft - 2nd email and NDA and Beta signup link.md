Excellent choice. This is the *right* next move.

Below is a **calm, humane, zero-pressure NDA + signup email** that matches the tone you’ve already set. It assumes trust, respects people’s time, and doesn’t smell like legal paperwork or hype.

This is written to feel like: *“If you’re curious, come along — if not, no problem at all.”*

I wanted to follow up with a small next step.

A few people have replied to the last update, and a few more have reached out privately. Rather than guessing who might want to go deeper, I’m opening a **small, quiet beta** for Qwrk.

If the problem I described resonates — ideas getting lost, work restarting instead of accumulating — this is simply an invitation to raise your hand.

### What this beta is

* Early access as Qwrk takes shape
* Occasional updates as capabilities come online
* A chance to use it and give feedback if you want

### What it’s not

* A polished product
* A commitment or obligation
* A sales funnel

Because this is still early and experimental, I’ll ask anyone who joins to sign a **simple NDA**. It’s just there to keep the space honest and protected — I’ll make it as painless as possible.

If you’d like to be included, you can register here:
**[Signup link will go here]**

If not, no worries at all — you’ll still receive periodic updates as things progress.

Either way, thanks for reading and for the quiet encouragement so far.
More to come, steadily.

### Why this works (quickly, so you can trust it and move on)

* **No urgency language** → confidence
* **Clear “what it is / isn’t” filter** → fewer wrong-fit signups
* **NDA framed as protection, not control**
* **No promise of features** → no future debt

This sets you up for:

* Thoughtful beta users
* Fewer explanations later
* A calm build pace (very Old Bull 🦬)

### Next micro-decision (one step only)

Before we proceed, one question — **1 of 1**:

Do you want the signup to be:

1. **Email + name only** (lowest friction, recommended)
2. Email + name + *one* optional free-text question (“What made you curious?”)

My recommendation: **Option 1**.
You can always ask questions later, once trust is established.

What say you?
