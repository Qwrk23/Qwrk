Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to:
- The Qwrk software platform and all features, functionality, and user interfaces
- Product roadmaps, feature plans, and development timelines
- Performance data, analytics, and usage metrics
- Documentation, guides, and training materials
- Any information marked as confidential or that would reasonably be considered confidential

## 2. Obligations

You agree to:
- Keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential
- Not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without prior written consent from Qwrk
- Not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than evaluating and testing the Qwrk beta software
- Protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care you use to protect your own confidential information
- Not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software provided

## 3. Exceptions

Your confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that:
- Was publicly known at the time of disclosure
- Becomes publicly known through no breach of this agreement by you
- Was rightfully in your possession prior to disclosure by Qwrk
- Is independently developed by you without use of Confidential Information
- Is required to be disclosed by law or court order (with prior notice to Qwrk)

## 4. Beta Program Understanding

You acknowledge and agree that:
- The beta software is pre-release and may contain bugs, errors, or incomplete features
