# Seed — Custom Qwrk Front End for Data Visibility & Control (v1)
**Date:** 2026-01-03 (CST)  
**Forest:** Qwrk  
**Thicket (intended):** Platform Evolution  
**Lifecycle:** seed  
**Operational state:** paused (not scheduled)  

---

## Purpose
Capture the strategic direction that Qwrk must evolve beyond purely conversational interfaces into a dedicated custom front end that gives users clear, interactive visibility into their data — while preserving conversational querying as a first-class path.

---

## The Seed (What this is)
Qwrk needs a **custom front end** that allows users to:

- **See** their artifacts (Forests, Thickets, Trees/Projects, Journals, Snapshots, Restarts, etc.) in structured views
- **Manually filter/sort** with fast controls (no “memory burden” on the user)
- **Chat with Qwrk** to query and refine those same views (hybrid UX)

This is not an “admin panel.”  
It is the **primary product surface** for user experience and long-term scale.

---

## Why this matters
- Conversation-only UI doesn’t scale for complex work streams and “at-a-glance” understanding.
- Visual exploration reduces friction and supports clarity, especially for non-technical users.
- This direction supports and justifies deterministic query semantics (selectors, filters, governed list/query patterns).

---

## Non-goals (explicit)
This seed does NOT mean we are:
- Building UI now
- Choosing a front-end stack now
- Designing screens or wireframes now
- Exposing raw tables directly to users
- Weakening governance for UX convenience

---

## Likely future capabilities (not locked)
- Multiple view modes: tables, widgets, charts, “visual explanations”
- Forest/Thicket/Tree themed navigation
- Visual progress metaphors (e.g., leaves growing on a branch as work advances)
- “Ask Qwrk” overlay to refine a filtered view (“show me all saplings in blocked state”)

---

## Promotion trigger (when this becomes sapling)
Promote this seed when:
- Core query/list semantics are stable (Gateway + selectors)
- We have at least one usable multi-artifact “dashboard-style” query experience
- We are ready to begin UI paper design (information architecture + view types)

---

## Notes
This seed is meant to preserve direction without forcing premature implementation choices.
